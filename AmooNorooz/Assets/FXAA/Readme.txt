  NVIDIA FXAA - Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing, by TIMOTHY LOTTES

  FXAA is a post-process anti-aliasing technique. While mostly used in deferred rendering
  pipelines that lack the ability to use hardware MSAA, it can also be used in combination 
  with hardware anti-aliasing to smooth out hard edges missed by MSAA (e.g. inside polygons).
